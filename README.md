The system should be capable of analyzing network traffic data to identify and classify various types of cyber-attacks (e.g., DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R) and distinguish them from normal network activity. The goal is to build a model that can effectively secure communication networks by providing an early warning of malicious activities.
